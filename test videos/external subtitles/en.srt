Transcriber:

2
00:00:00,079 --> 00:00:02,873
Are we designed to nap during the day?

[Sleeping With Science]

4
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:12,090
Most people aim to get their recommended seven to nine hours of sleep

5
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:14,425
in one long stretch at night.

6
00:00:14,426 --> 00:00:17,636
And the technical term for this is “monophasic sleep.”

7
00:00:17,679 --> 00:00:21,016
In other words, a single bout of sleep at night.

8
00:00:21,059 --> 00:00:22,226
However,

9
00:00:22,225 --> 00:00:26,020
we may not have been programmed to sleep in this way.

10
00:00:26,064 --> 00:00:28,858
Now I'm sure you've had that experience

11
00:00:28,899 --> 00:00:32,109
of a drop in your alertness in the afternoon,

12
00:00:32,152 --> 00:00:34,612
where you start to feel a little sleepy.

13
00:00:34,613 --> 00:00:37,157
And you can also see it in other people as well,

14
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,078
as their heads begin sort of bobbing up and down

15
00:00:40,078 --> 00:00:41,870
during afternoon meetings.

16
00:00:41,912 --> 00:00:46,083
Now you may think this afternoon drop in your alertness

17
00:00:46,125 --> 00:00:48,376
is because of a big lunch,

18
00:00:48,418 --> 00:00:50,003
but in actual fact,

19
00:00:50,045 --> 00:00:52,089
it seems to be hardwired.

20
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:55,009
Because if I place electrodes on your head,

21
00:00:55,009 --> 00:00:58,553
there is a reliable, preprogrammed drop

22
00:00:58,554 --> 00:01:01,223
in your brain’s alertness during the afternoon.

23
00:01:01,265 --> 00:01:05,686
And it happens to most of us somewhere between the one to four pm mark.

24
00:01:05,686 --> 00:01:06,853
What this suggests

25
00:01:06,896 --> 00:01:10,816
is that we may have been designed to sleep in a biphasic pattern,

26
00:01:10,816 --> 00:01:13,985
meaning one longer bout of sleep at night

27
00:01:14,028 --> 00:01:17,240
and then a short afternoon nap during the day,

28
00:01:17,281 --> 00:01:20,951
very much like the siesta cultures around the world.

29
00:01:20,992 --> 00:01:23,995
But is napping always a good thing?

30
00:01:23,995 --> 00:01:25,996
Well, not necessarily.

31
00:01:26,331 --> 00:01:28,166
Although we and other scientists

32
00:01:28,209 --> 00:01:30,837
have discovered that naps can have benefits

33
00:01:30,878 --> 00:01:33,547
for both the brain and for the body,

34
00:01:33,588 --> 00:01:36,257
naps can be a double-edged sword.

35
00:01:36,259 --> 00:01:39,971
Long naps in the afternoon or in the early evening

36
00:01:39,971 --> 00:01:43,431
can just take the edge off your sleepiness.

37
00:01:43,474 --> 00:01:46,686
It's a little bit like snacking before your main meal.

38
00:01:46,727 --> 00:01:49,896
So if you are struggling with sleep at night,

39
00:01:49,938 --> 00:01:53,900
the best advice is not to nap during the day.

40
00:01:53,942 --> 00:01:57,736
Instead, build up all of that healthy sleepiness

41
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:02,076
so that you give yourself the best chance of falling asleep easily

42
00:02:02,075 --> 00:02:05,744
and then staying asleep soundly across the night.

43
00:02:05,745 --> 00:02:07,955
But if you're not struggling with sleep

44
00:02:07,956 --> 00:02:11,209
and you can nap regularly during the day,

45
00:02:11,252 --> 00:02:15,548
the naps of around 20 minutes taken early in the day

46
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:17,340
can be just fine.
