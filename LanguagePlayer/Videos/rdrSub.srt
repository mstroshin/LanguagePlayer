1
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:05,960
Listen to me, we don’t want to kill any of you...

2
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:08,680
But trust me, we will.

3
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:10,600
Wake 'em up a little!

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,640
This whole thing is pretty much done.

5
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,360
We're more ghosts than people.

6
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,960
You have got to keep faith.

7
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:32,440
They will not crush us.

8
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,880
Good old Dutch, my best friend...

9
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:46,280
You know how we met? 

10
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,680
A pair of hucksters trying to rob each other…

11
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:51,560
Back in '78 or thereabouts.

12
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,720
You have to love yourself a fire.

13
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,520
It's one of the blessings.

14
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,760
Sure, we can have fire...

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,400
And we can have the knowledge of fire...

16
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,440
But with that comes the knowledge of everything.

17
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,960
Ladies and gentlemen, this is a robbery.

18
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,560
Sons of Dutch

19
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,880
Makes us brothers

20
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,440
Sometimes, brothers make mistakes.

21
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,480
You'll never change. I know that.

22
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,320
All of you venerate savagery...

23
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,000
And you will die savagely.

24
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,480
Get out here!

25
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,440
Stay strong.

26
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,640
Stay with me.

27
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,520
You have to love yourself a fire.
